/**
 * This example demonstrates various toxic agent flow patterns:
 * 
 * 1. **Privilege Escalation Flow**: Public access → Private access → Data exfiltration
 * 2. **Cross-Platform Exfiltration**: Local file access → External service communication
 * 3. **Indirect Prompt Injection**: External content processing → Privileged action execution
 * 4. **Multi-Step Attack Chain**: Coordinated sequence of escalating actions
 * 5. **Cross-Resource Escalation**: Automatic privilege escalation across resources
 * 
 * These patterns should be detected by the enhanced Secure-Hulk scanner with the new
 * toxic flow analysis rules and checks.
